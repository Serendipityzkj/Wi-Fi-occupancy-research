1. Folder: “CNN_model_output”
This folder contains the trained CNN model obtained after completing the model training process.

2. Folder: “GBC data”
This folder includes the training and testing datasets used for developing the Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) model.

3. Files with the “.ipynb” extension
These files are the original model-training notebooks. They can be opened and executed using Jupyter Notebook.

4. Files with the “.html” extension
These files provide a complete demonstration of a full model-training process.

5. Model and dataset files
The file “gradient_boosting_model_best.pkl” stores the trained GBC model.
The file “Input_data_CNN.csv” contains the dataset used for training the CNN model.
